  abstract = {We present a unified method, based on symmetric diffeomorphisms,
	for studying longitudinal neurodegeneration. Our method first uses
	symmetric diffeomorphic normalization to find a spatiotemporal parameterization
	of an individual's image time series. The second step involves mapping
	a representative image or set of images from the time series into
	an optimal template space. The template mapping is then combined
	with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical
	tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images.
	Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray
	matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
	We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero)
	and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that
	estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization
	enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo
	significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We
	found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and
	temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant
	effects in the hippocampus, insula and cingulate gyrus. Our novel
	results, significant at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction,
	are represented in local template space but also assigned Talairach
	coordinates and Brodmann and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL)
	labels. This paper shows the statistical power of symmetric diffeomorphic
	normalization for performing deformation-based studies of longitudinal
	atrophy.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for reliable, unbiased, multivariate longitudinal
	analysis of cortical and white matter atrophy rates with penalized
	statistical methods. The pipeline uses a step-wise approach to transform
	and personalize template information first to a single-subject template
	(SST) and then to the individual's time series data. The first stream
	of information flows from group template to the SST; the second flows
	from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased,
	prior-based segmentation and measurement of cortical thickness. MRI-bias
	correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation
	and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of
	the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping
	between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach
	with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological
	problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces
	(a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content
	as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance
	estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data
	is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when
	combined with sparse canonical correlation analysis--reveals plausible,
	significant, annualized decline in cortical thickness and white matter
	volume when contrasting frontotemporal dementia and normal aging.},

  abstract = {We contribute a novel and interpretable dimensionality reduction
	strategy, eigenanatomy, that is tuned for neuroimaging data. The
	method approximates the eigendecomposition of an image set with basis
	functions (the eigenanatomy vectors) that are sparse, unsigned and
	are anatomically clustered. We employ the eigenanatomy vectors as
	anatomical predictors to improve detection power in morphometry.
	Standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel--and
	follows this with cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons
	correction methods to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses
	the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data
	and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality
	space. As with traditional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, this
	strategy can greatly improve detection power. Our results show that
	eigenanatomy provides a principled objective function that leads
	to localized, data-driven regions of interest. These regions improve
	our ability to quantify biologically plausible rates of cortical
	change in two distinct forms of neurodegeneration. We detail the
	algorithm and show experimental evidence of its efficacy.},

	disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Analysis of structure

	(MRI) has the potential to generate insights on disease associations

	Das, S., Minkoff, D., Mechanic-Hamilton, D., Glynn, S., Pickup, S.,
	Liu, W., Gee, J.C., Grossman, M., Detre, J.A., 2009. A high-resolution
	computational atlas of the human hippocampus from postmortem magnetic
	resonance imaging at 9.4 T. NeuroImage 44 (2), 385-398) was used
	to label hippocampal subregions, making it possible to examine subfield-level
	functional activation during an episodic memory task in two different
	cohorts of healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with intractable
	unilateral TLE. We report, for the first time, functional activation
	patterns within hippocampal subfields in TLE. We detected group differences
	in subfield activation between patients and controls as well as inter-hemispheric
	activation asymmetry within subfields in patients, with dentate gyrus
	(DG) and the anterior hippocampus region showing the greatest effects.
	DG was also found to be more active than CA1 in controls, but not
	in patients' epileptogenic side. These preliminary results will encourage
	further research on the utility of subfield-based biomarkers in TLE.},

	amygdala from MRI images collected from 35 human subjects. This approach
	is adapted from open-source techniques employed previously with the
	hippocampus (Suh et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011a,b). Using multi-atlas
	segmentation and machine learning-based correction, we were able
	to produce automated amygdala segments with high Dice (Mean?=?0.918
	for the left amygdala; 0.916 for the right amygdala) and Jaccard
	coefficients (Mean?=?0.850 for the left; 0.846 for the right) compared
	to rigorously hand-traced volumes. This automated routine also produced
	amygdala segments with high intra-class correlations (consistency?=?0.830,
	absolute agreement?=?0.819 for the left; consistency?=?0.786, absolute
	agreement?=?0.783 for the right) and bivariate (r?=?0.831 for the
	left; r?=?0.797 for the right) compared to hand-drawn amygdala. Our
	results are discussed in relation to other cutting-edge segmentation
	techniques, as well as commonly available approaches to amygdala
	segmentation (e.g., Freesurfer). We believe this new technique has
	broad application to research with large sample sizes for which amygdala
	quantification might be needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly
	associated with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology
	at autopsy, but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating
	between sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it
	is critical to accurately identify underlying pathology in living
	patients so that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed
	clinical trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to
	have relatively greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than
	those patients with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate
	the ability of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between
	FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging
	(DTI). METHODS: Patients with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic
	mutation consistent with FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal
	T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion weighted imaging scans. We quantified
	cortical thickness in GM and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We
	performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically robust dimensionality reduction
	algorithm, and used leave-one-out cross-validation to predict underlying
	pathology. Neuropathological assessment of GM and WM disease burden
	was performed in the autopsy-cases to confirm our findings of an
	ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation in the neuroimaging cohort. RESULTS:
	ROC curve analyses evaluated classification accuracy in individual
	patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for
	WM analyses. FTLD-TAU had significantly more WM degeneration and
	inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP. CONCLUSIONS:
	These neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging
	evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLD-TAU, and emphasise
	the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU
	and FTLD-TDP.},

  abstract = {Image registration is one of the most important and universally useful
	computational tasks in biomedical image analysis. A recent article
	by Xing \& Qiu (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine
	Intelligence, 33(10):2081-2092, 2011) is based on an inappropriately
	narrow conceptualization of the image registration problem as the
	task of making two images look alike, which disregards whether the
	established spatial correspondence is plausible. The authors propose
	a new algorithm, Nonparametric Local Smoothing (NLS) for image registration,
	but use image similarities alone as a measure of registration performance,
	although these measures do not relate reliably to the realism of
	the correspondence map.Using data obtained from its authors, we show
	experimentally that the method proposed by Xing \& Qiu is not an
	effective registration algorithm. While it optimizes image similarity,
	it does not compute accurate, interpretable transformations. Even
	judged by image similarity alone, the proposed method is consistently
	outperformed by a simple pixel permutation algorithm, which is known
	by design not to compute valid registrations.This study has demonstrated
	that the NLS algorithm proposed recently for image registration,
	and published in one of the most respected journals in computer science,
	is not, in fact, an effective registration method at all. Our results
	also emphasize the general need to apply registration evaluation
	criteria that are sensitive to whether correspondences are accurate
	and mappings between images are physically interpretable. These goals
	cannot be achieved by simply reporting image similarities.},

	upon our previous neurocognitive studies by specifically investigating
	the hypothesis that changes in neural connectivity relate to cognitive
	impairment in children with the disorder.Whole brain analyses of
	multiple measures computed from diffusion tensor image data acquired
	from the brains of children with the disorder and typically developing
	controls. We also correlated diffusion tensor data with performance
	on a visuospatial cognitive task that taps spatial attention.Analyses
	revealed four common clusters, in the parietal and frontal lobes,
	that showed complementary patterns of connectivity in children with
	the deletion and typical controls. We interpreted these results as
	indicating differences in connective complexity to adjoining cortical
	regions that are critical to the cognitive functions in which affected
	children show impairments. Strong, and similarly opposing patterns
	of correlations between diffusion values in those clusters and spatial
	attention performance measures considerably strengthened that interpretation.Our
	results suggest that atypical development of connective patterns
	in the brains of children with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
	indicate a neuropathology that is related to the visuospatial cognitive
	impairments that are commonly found in affected individuals.},

  abstract = {Brain MRI segmentation remains a challenging problem in spite of
	numerous existing techniques. To overcome the inherent difficulties
	associated with this segmentation problem, we present a new method
	of information integration in a graph based framework. In addition
	to image intensity, tissue priors and local boundary information
	are integrated into the edge weight metrics in the graph. Furthermore,
	inhomogeneity correction is incorporated by adaptively adjusting
	the edge weights according to the intermediate inhomogeneity estimation.
	In the validation experiments of simulated brain MRIs, the proposed
	method outperformed a segmentation method based on iterated conditional
	modes (ICM), which is a commonly used optimization method in medical
	image segmentation. In the experiments of real neonatal brain MRIs,
	the results of the proposed method have good overlap with the manual
	segmentations by human experts.},

  __markedentry = {[stnava:]},
  abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted
	the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design.
	Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the
	course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially
	corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration
	plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as
	the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps
	each subject's image to a representative template before performing
	statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically
	demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference
	(SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification
	of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an
	experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate
	how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric
	used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related
	metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics
	which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences
	will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability
	in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we
	caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related
	measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the
	same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where
	normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space
	occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of
	statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms
	that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.  2012

  abstract = {Spatial normalization of diffusion tensor images plays a key role
	in voxel-based analysis of white matter (WM) group differences. Currently,
	it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in
	the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate
	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating
	evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an
	ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three
	normalization methods representing the current range of available
	approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy
	(FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional
	normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed
	in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between
	ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization
	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the
	alignment of WM tracts.},
